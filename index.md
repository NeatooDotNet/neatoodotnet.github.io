Neatoo is a DDD Aggregate Framework for .NET C#. It specializes in creating bindable and serializable Aggregate Entity Graphs for Blazor and WPF.
The goal is to define the business logic once and reuse it in both the UI and the Application Service. 
Neatoo uniquely uses Roslyn Source Generators to create readable and performant code specific to the Entities.

Features:
* Validation
* Authorization
* Bindable Properties
* Bindable Meta-Properties
* 3-Tier Factory
* Dependency Injection
* Async/Await
* Live Source Generation

#### With Neatoo you can create Blazor Business applications with much less code!
